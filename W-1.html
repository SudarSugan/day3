    <h2>Why their chip storage?</h2>
    <p3>
      The tech industry is at a crunch point. Today, millions of products -
      cars, washing machines, smartphones, and more - rely on computer chips,
      also known as semiconductors.<br />
      <br />
      And right now, there just aren't enough of them to meet industry demand.
      As a result, many popular products are in short supply.<br />
      <br />
      It has become almost impossible to buy a PS5 games console. Toyota, Ford
      and Volvo have had to either slow or temporarily halt production at their
      factories. Smartphone makers are feeling the pinch too, with Apple warning
      that the shortage could affect iPhone sales.<br />
      <br />
      Even companies that wouldn't necessarily be associated with computer chips
      haven't been spared, such as CSSI international, a US firm that makes
      dog-grooming machines, is feeling the effects.<br />
      <br />
      Some shoppers have already noticed these problems. Sales of used-cars are
      up, for instance, because new vehicles, often packed with thousands of
      individual chips, are in short supply. <br />

        His current lease ends in October and under the rules of the scheme he
        must replace his car at that time. However, his local dealership has
        told him that the car he ordered has been delayed until January next
        year at the earliest.<br />
        <br />
        "As a disabled person I am really, really reliant on my car," says Mr
        Halpin, who uses a wheelchair. "Where I live, I literally couldn't get
        beyond my drive without my car."<br />
        <br />
        Thankfully, Mr Halpin says that Motability agreed to extend the lease
        and insurance on his current car until the new one arrives.<br />
        <br />
        In the coming months and, particularly over Christmas, it's possible
        that even more products will fall foul of the shortage.<br />
        <br />
        So, what is going on?<br />
        <br />
        The chips that are in short supply perform various functions in modern
        products, and there are often more than one in a single device.<br />

        Piotr Esden-Tempski is the founder and owner of 1bitsquared, a US-based
        firm that specialises in electronics hardware. He has orders on his
        books for several thousand electronics interface boards, which allow
        students and makers to connect various appliances to their computers.

      But Mr Esden-Tempski's suppliers say that some of the components he needs
      containing semiconductors will not be available for 12 months or more.
      "You cannot just assemble it and miss one part, it won't work," he says.
